## RENTX

<p>
  The project consists of developing a car rental platform.
</p>

  alt="It has 'rentx' logo and below the logo there is a phrase 'rent a car in a simple and easy way' and another phrase is 'several models for you to drive safely, comfortably and safely' and an image of the audi a3 model" />

<p>
  Clicking the red button above "Start Now" will display the car listings and have a navigation view for the menus.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Home - house icon</li>
    <li>Cars - car icon</li>
    <li>Profile - profile icon</li>
  </ul>

  alt="list of cars it contains to rent them." 
/>

<p>
  Throughout the project I will be adding new features to the platform.

The development is going like this, on the side:

- Frontend: Angular
- Backend: Json-server (api-fake), in the future the endpoint will be built using nodejs, postgresql to manage the database.

I hope to detail the project enough.

Remembering that this project was made by rocketseat using reactjs. However, for the study and practice of my day-to-day I decided to develop this same project using Angular.

A way to improve my code and put into practice reading "book - clean code".
